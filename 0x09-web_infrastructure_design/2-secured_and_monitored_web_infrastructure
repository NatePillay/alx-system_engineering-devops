On a design of 3 server web infastructure that hosts website 
www.foobar.com 
it must be secured, serve encrypted traffic, and be monitored.

What are firewalls for?
Firewalls are used to protect the servers and the infastructure from unauthorized access and malicious traffic
they contorl inflow/outflow of network traffic based on predefined security rules
Acting as a guardian to allow or block packets of data

Why is the traffic served over HTTPS?
HTTPS is for secure and encrypted communication between the web server and the client. To protect all sensitive information

What is monitoring used for?
Data collection in regard to server (performance, resource utilization and errors)
Find bottlenecks, assess performance and find avaliability to optimize
The monitoring tool collects data from the servers through monitoring agents or clients that are installed on each server
CPU usgae
Memory usage
network traffic
- Monitoring is configured to
    i. collect web server data
    ii. triggers an alert if QPS (Query Per Second) is getting out of control


Problems to overcome:
- Terminating SSL at load balancer level leaves traffic between the load balancer and web servers unencrypted and exposed to attack
-If the primary MySQL server fails, the entire application will become unavailable until the server is restored or a failover mechanism is implemented.
-Having servers with all the same components (database, web server, and application server) can make the infrastructure vulnerable to common vulnerabilities that affect all the components. 
-if there is a vulnerability in the web server software, all the servers running the software will be affected. It
