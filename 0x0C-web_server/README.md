cp stands for "secure copy" and it is a command used to transfer files securely between a local and a remote machine. It uses the SSH protocol to authenticate and encrypt data during the transfer.

In the script, the scp command is used to transfer a file from a local machine (the client) to a remote machine (the server). Here's a breakdown of the command:

bash
Copy code
scp -o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" -i "$SSH_KEY_PATH" "$FILE_PATH" "$SSH_USERNAME@$SERVER_IP:~/"
scp: The command to use secure copy
-o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no": Disables strict host key checking, which means that scp will automatically add the server's key to the known_hosts file without prompting for confirmation. This is useful for automating transfers in scripts, but be aware that it can make the connection vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
-i "$SSH_KEY_PATH": Specifies the path to the SSH private key that scp uses to authenticate with the server.
"$FILE_PATH": The path to the file that will be transferred.
"$SSH_USERNAME@$SERVER_IP:~/ ": The destination for the transferred file. "$SSH_USERNAME" is the username used to authenticate with the server, "$SERVER_IP" is the IP address or hostname of the server, and :~/ indicates the home directory of the remote user.
When you run this command, scp will establish an SSH connection to the server and securely transfer the specified file to the specified location. Once the transfer is complete, the script will output "File transfer complete."
